	<h1 class="dc">Washington, D.C.</h1>

	<h2 class="one">Day One</h2>
	<p class="one animated fadeInDown">We left home at 5am on a Saturday morning to head for Washington, D.C. It was a long bus ride filled with sleeping, watching movies, and talking with all of our friends. Bus rides are not always fun but when you have your closest friends near by, it is all worth it. We made a couple stops along the way, but in total the trip was around fourteen hours long. We were all so relieved to reach DC. We stayed right in the center of the city at a very old church. The second we got our beds set up, we all went straight to sleep. </p>

	<h2 class="two">Day Two</h2>
	<p class="two animated fadeInDown">We woke up early in the morning for a day filled with sightseeing of Washington, D.C. We saw things like the Washington Monument, Lincoln Memorial, White House, Vietnam War Memorial, and the World War Two Memorial. It was really cool to see things that I have seen in textbooks in real life. We were all hoping to see the president or someone of high authority, but unfortunately we were not so lucky. We did a lot of walking this day, but it was definitely worth it. </p>

	<h2 class="three">Day Three</h2>
	<p class="three animated fadeInDown">At the same time we were in Washington, the Stanley Hockey Cup was taking place. The church we were staying at was directly across the street from the block party for the game, so we were able to be a part of it. There was a huge crowd of Capitols fans gathered to watch the big game on the screen. It was a very cool experience to be a part of something so big in Washington, DC. Washington D.C.â€™s team won and the crowd went wild. After this night, we all became Washington Capitol fans.</p>

	<h2 class="four">Day Four</h2>
	<p class="four animated fadeInDown">On the fourth day, we traveled to Annapolis, Maryland to tour the United States Naval Academy. One of our past youth actually attends this school, so we were able to have a nice visit with her. The campus was beautiful and it was so cool to hear about all the things the cadets take part in. Meagan was able to provide some insight of a day at the Naval Academy and it sounded very challenging. The tour was very rewarding and it made me feel an even more sense of pride for our country.

	<h2 class="five">Day Five</h2>
	<p class="five animated fadeInDown">The fifth day was probably my favorite. On this day, we went to Six Flags America in Maryland. I love to ride roller coasters so this amusement park was perfect for me. We went there on a weekday and school was still in session in Maryland during this time, so there was nobody at the park. We were able to walk right up to a roller coaster and ride it. We could even stay on for multiple trips on the roller coasters. My favorite roller coaster was the Superman because it had such huge drops on it. </p>
